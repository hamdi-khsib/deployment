  <data key="d0">define the plan risk responses concept. this defines the general approach to managing risk on the project. it also defines the specific responses that are to be implemented on the project. risk categories. provide a means for grouping individual project risks. a common way to structure risk categories is with a risk breakdown structure rbs  which is a hierarchical representation of potential sources of risk see example in    . an rbs helps the project team consider the full range of sources from which individual project risks may arise. this can be useful when identifying risks or when categorizing identified risks. the organization may have a generic rbs to be used for all projects  or it may develop generic risk responses to be used on individual project risks. table     provides an example of the definitions used in the risk responses process. – risk breakdown structure root level probability  .</data>
